# sMVC
sMVC is an MVC (Model-View-Controller) application framework for PHP. 
It provides clear separation between the data (Model), the presentation (View), and the glue in between (Controller).
This framework was created to support a PHP course and is therefore not a production framework.<br>

So sMVC is not a complete framework that already contains all kinds of libraries and software components. 
Out-of-the-box it only offers an MVC structure with support for database operations via the PDO class 
The framework can be extended according to your own needs by own classes and functions or by third-party libraries (https://packagist.org/) that you can install via composer. 
This means the framework is the ideal basis to master programming in PHP.
